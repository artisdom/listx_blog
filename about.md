Hello! My name is Linus Arver and this is my blog.

Please email me at `linus at ucla dot edu` for anything related to this blog.
I have long since graduated from UCLA, but they gave me a lifetime email address. ;)

Recommended Software
--------------------

I use free/open-source software almost exclusively as much as possible.
Here are some of them I heartily recommend.

- [Arch Linux][arch] - my favorite OS
- [dm-crypt/LUKS][crypto] - my choice for block device encryption
- [Terminus][terminus] - my favorite monospaced font
- [rxvt-unicode][urxvt] (aka `urxvt`) - the only sane Unicode-aware terminal emulator
- [Xmonad][xmonad] - the crash-proof tiled window manager
- [Vim][vim] - an advanced text editor
- [Emacs][emacs] - an even more advanced text editor
- [evil][evil] - an Emacs addon that makes it behave like Vim
- [git][git] - distributed data versioning
- [GnuPG][gpg] (aka `gpg`) - a way to ensure secure communications
- [Firefox][firefox] - the most mature and stable *customizable* web browser
- [Pentadactyl][penta] - addon to make Firefox behave like Vim
- [Texlive][texlive] - the modern TeX environment (XeTeX being my preferred engine)
- [Lilypond][lily] - if TeX is the sophisticated typesetting system, then Lilypond is the sophisticated sheet-music-setting system
- [Blender][blend] - an advanced 3D graphics program
- [Luxrender][luxrender] - an advanced photorealistic renderer, which pairs nicely with Blender via [luxblend][luxblend]

Programming
-----------

I have fun writing computer programs.
It is by far my favorite hobby.
I program mainly in [Haskell][haskell], ever since I discovered it around 2009.
I also program some pet projects in [C][c].
