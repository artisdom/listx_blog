Here is a list of pet programming projects.
Let me know if any of them suffers from bit rot.

## Games

### simtic

Simtic (C/Linux) is a text-based, dead-simple tic-tac-toe game with an AI that uses minimax search.

## Utilities

### auca

Auca (Haskell/Linux) watches for file modifications and execute a given external command.
The name comes from a contraction of "auto" and "call".

- [Git repository](https://github.com/listx/auca)
- [Source manual](file/auca-0.1.1-5-g655f518.pdf)[^gendoc]

### nox

Nox (Haskell/Linux) comments/uncomments text from STDIN and prints the result to STDOUT.
The name comes from "no *x*", where *x* is a chunk of source code that you'd want to comment out.

- [Git repository](https://github.com/listx/nox)
- [Source manual](file/nox-0.1.0-4-gf123c9e.pdf)
- [Sample use case](post/2013-04-30-emacs-unix-filter.html)

[^gendoc]: The source manual can be generated from the development sources if you have [TexLive](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) installed on your system.
The manual is provided here as a convenience for those who do not have TexLive.
