Here is a list of more serious writings.
"Serious" here means anything that took me more than a few sittings to write and revise, as anything that takes less than that would most likely just get uploaded as a blog post.

### [Bitscans and De Bruijn Sequences (2014)](http://linusarver.com/upload/grid/file/attachment/fyle/549e65206c30005598000000/debruijn-sequence-tutorial.pdf)

I wrote this paper originally in 2011--2012, but it was not released until it was finally revised in 2014.


### Haskell for Newbies (tentative title, coming 2016)

This will be a short PDF on getting started writing Haskell programs.
The goal of the paper will be to introduce Haskell to beginners, and to explain things *without* any reference to mathematics dealing with category theory.
