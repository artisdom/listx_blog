#+STARTUP: indent showall

I love [[https://github.com/jonas/tig][tig]].
Still, I think the defaults aren't the best for most developers.
Here are two easy customizations to make the default view better.

First, put

#+begin_src bash
alias tig='tig -n 1000'
#+end_src

in your =~/.bashrc= to reduce tig's startup time (especially on large repositories).
There's rarely a need to go back more than 1000 commits from your current HEAD position in an interactive, GUI-driven manner.
And if you really need to see everything, do

#+begin_src bash
$ \tig
#+end_src

on the terminal to bypass the shell alias.

Second, put the following in your =~/.tigrc= file:

#+begin_src
set main-view = date author id:width=10 commit-title:yes,graph,refs
#+end_src

.
This makes the default view show git commit hashes (where =width= is the number of hex digits to show), so that you don't have to press ENTER on a particular commit to see its hash.

Happy hacking!
