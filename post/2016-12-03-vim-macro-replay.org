#+STARTUP: indent showall

I've been using Vim (and now, Emacs with Evil mode) for years --- and still, every once in a while I get a pleasant surprise.
Today I learned that you can replay macros from Visual Line mode!
So you don't always have to record something like ~j0~ at the end of your macro to get down to the next line.
I.e., after recording your macro for just 1 line, select other lines that you want to replay the macro against with Visual Line mode (~V~).
To replay, do

#+begin_src
:'<,'>g/^/norm @q
#+end_src

(assuming that you recorded your macro into the ~q~ register with ~qq...q~).
